  title: Hi Tom, I'm me
  description: I've been a Product Manager 'doing' SEO for coming on 4 years now, and I've been extremely lucky to have been afforded opportunities aplenty to try out a great many hypotheses and get paid while doing it. I've learned buckets of stuff and earned some big wins along the way, but I've always been aware that my SEO knowledge is theoretical in the sense that *I can't physically do any of the things I tell people to do all day*. This is clearly a privileged position to be in, but learning by doing always has a certain inherent value. As no actual software engineer in their right mind will let me near a production codebase (for good reason), I'm building this site.

reasoning:
  blurb: I doubt I'll ever reach quite the level of tech SEO experiments or tooling of some of the fantastic people in the community out there, but I hope to test out some hypotheses and cut my teeth in *actual coding* to gain a practical perspective of the work I organize daily.

  Regardless, I'll be posting a few results and potentially host some non-SEO tools here. There will also likely be some more miscellaneous posts that don't fit and will likely tank my topical relevance, but oh well. It is what it is.
